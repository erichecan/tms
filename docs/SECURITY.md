### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Security researchers will be credited in our security advisories
- We may offer bounties for significant vulnerabilities (program details TBD)
- Contributors will be added to our security hall of fame

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection

- Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### API Security

- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request validation with Joi schemas
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (Helmet.js)

### Infrastructure Security

- Container security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and logging

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk)
- Static code analysis
- Container image scanning
- Security linting

### Manual Security Testing

We conduct regular:

- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Infrastructure security audits
- Third-party security assessments

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying any changes, we verify:

- [ ] Input validation implemented

- Implement proper error handling
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

### Data Handling

- Never log sensitive data
- Encrypt sensitive information
- Implement proper data retention
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

### Authentication

- Use strong password requirements
- Implement account lockout policies
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Use secure session management

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If You Discover a Security Issue

1. **Stop** what you're doing
2. **Document** the issue immediately
3. **Do not** attempt to exploit further
4. **Report** through proper channels
5. **Wait** for guidance before taking action

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of report
2. **Investigate** the vulnerability
3. **Develop** and test fix
4. **Deploy** security patch
5. **Notify** affected users
6. **Document** lessons learned

## 🔎 Data Minimization & Field-level Masking

- PII fields (phone/email) are masked by default in responses based on role.
- Sensitive financial breakdown is visible to FINANCE/ADMIN only; others get aggregated totals.
- Masking applied at serialization layer; auditing stores both masked and raw values with access control.

## 🗂️ Audit Retention & Access Control

- Retention: ≥ 365 days for audit logs; export requires AUDITOR role and approval.
- Audit entries record who/when/where/what with before/after diffs; PII redaction applied.
- Access is logged; suspicious access triggers alerts.

## ♻️ Idempotency & Anti-Replay

- All mutating endpoints accept `Idempotency-Key`; server deduplicates and returns first result.
- Signature of request = URL + tenantId + normalized body; stored in durable store (DB/Redis) with TTL.
- Prevent replay by binding key to actor and short validity window.

## 🔐 RBAC/ABAC Enforcement

- Route guards enforce role checks; object-level checks verify ownership (`driverId` matches actor for driver flows).
- Field-level policies applied post-controller pre-serialization.
- High-risk ops (rule publish, financial posting, bulk export) require dual approval and full audit.
